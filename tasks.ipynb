    "## **Task 1: Binary Representations**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we focus on implementing several core functions that manipulate binary representations of 32-bit unsigned integers. These operations are crucial in many fields, including cryptography (like SHA-256), data encoding, and low-level programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circular Shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular shifts (or bit rotations) involve shifting the bits of a number to the left or right, with the bits that \"fall off\" one end reappearing on the opposite end. This operation is distinct from logical shifts, where bits shifted off one end are simply discarded and zeros are introduced on the other end. Circular shifts maintain the bit-length and the overall \"weight\" of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you perform a left circular shift (`rotl`) on a 32-bit integer:\n",
    "- The bits are moved to the left by a specified number of positions.\n",
    "- The bits that move past the most significant bit are wrapped around to the least significant bit positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a right circular shift (`rotr`) moves bits to the right with wrapping from the rightmost bits to the leftmost positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information, see the [Circular Shift Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bitwise Operators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several bitwise operators that allow for efficient manipulation of integers at the binary level:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AND (`&`):** Compares each bit of two integers and returns `1` only if both bits are `1`.\n",
    "- **OR (`|`):** Compares each bit of two integers and returns `1` if at least one of the bits is `1`.\n",
    "- **XOR (`^`):** Returns `1` for each bit position where the corresponding bits of the two operands are different.\n",
    "- **NOT (`~`):** Inverts the bits of the operand.\n",
    "- **Left Shift (`<<`):** Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.\n",
    "- **Right Shift (`>>`):** Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators form the foundation for our binary manipulation functions. Detailed explanations and examples can be found at [GeeksforGeeks Bitwise Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-bitwise-operators/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Task 1 involves implementing critical binary operations using circular shifts and bitwise operators. These functions serve as building blocks for more complex algorithms like SHA-256 and are widely applicable in many areas of computer science. By understanding and implementing `rotl`, `rotr`, `ch`, and `maj`, you not only gain proficiency in bitwise manipulation but also lay the groundwork for further exploration into cryptographic and low-level programming concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further reading and a deeper understanding, explore the [Circular Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift) and [Bitwise Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-bitwise-operators/) articles.\n"

    "After testing various candidates—such as bases `[31, 37, 257]` and moduli `[101, 127, 10_007]`—the values `31` and `101` have emerged as effective choices. As highlighted in Joshua Bloch's [*Effective Java*](https://ia800308.us.archive.org/16/items/java_20230528/Joshua%20Bloch%20-%20Effective%20Java%20%283rd%29%20-%202018.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The value 31 was chosen because it is an odd prime. If it were even and the multiplication overflowed, information would be lost, because multiplication by 2 is equivalent to shifting. The advantage of using a prime is less clear, but it is traditional.  \n",
    "> A nice property of 31 is that the multiplication can be replaced by a shift and a subtraction for better performance on some architectures: `31 * i == (i << 5) - i`. Modern VMs do this sort of optimization automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `31` as the multiplier helps to generate a well-distributed hash by combining the contributions of each character in a string. Its odd prime nature avoids the pitfalls of even multipliers—such as losing information on overflow—and the computational shortcut (shifting and subtracting) can improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the modulus `101` is chosen because it is a prime number. A prime modulus helps minimize collisions by ensuring a more uniform distribution of hash values. While the exact advantage of using a prime modulus like `101` might be less pronounced than that of the multiplier, it remains a traditional choice that has been proven effective in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the combination of `31` and `101` has been historically favored in hash function design due to their mathematical properties and performance benefits, which remain relevant even as testing with other numbers (e.g., `37`, `257` for the base and `127`, `10_007` for the modulus) might show similar behavior in certain scenarios.\n"

    "# **Task 3: SHA256 Padding**\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to implement a Python function that computes the SHA256 padding for a given file. This involves reading the file's contents in binary mode, calculating the padding according to the SHA256 ([SHA-2 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)) specification as detailed in [NIST FIPS 180-4](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4), and outputting the resulting padding in hexadecimal format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SHA256 algorithm, before the input message is processed, it must be padded to satisfy the requirement that its total length (in bits) is congruent to 448 modulo 512. This is achieved by appending the following to the original message:\n",
    "- **A single `1` bit:** Represented in hexadecimal as `0x80` (binary: `10000000`).\n",
    "- **A series of `0` bits:** Enough zeros are appended so that the length of the message (after adding `0x80` and the zeros) is 56 bytes modulo 64. This ensures that, once an 8-byte (64-bit) representation of the original message length is appended, the overall message length is a multiple of 64 bytes (512 bits).\n",
    "- **The original message length:** The length (in bits) of the original input is appended as a 64-bit big-endian integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is described in detail in [NIST FIPS 180-4](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4), which is the official document for the Secure Hash Standard (SHS). Additional context can be found on the [SHA-2 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) Wikipedia page and in [RFC 6234](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6234), which provide overviews and implementation notes for SHA-256.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the implementation should:\n",
    "- Open and read the file in binary mode.\n",
    "- Append `0x80` to the file's contents to indicate the start of the padding.\n",
    "- Calculate the number of zero bytes needed so that, with the additional 8-byte length field, the total length is a multiple of 64 bytes.\n",
    "- Append the original message length (in bits) as a 64-bit big-endian integer.\n"

    "    We then calculate how many zero bytes are needed so that the total length (orignal message + 0x80 + zeros) is 56 bytes modulo 64. This ensures that when we later add the 8-byte length, the full message length becomes a multiple of 64 bytes (512 bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Appeding the Message Length:**\n",
    "    The orignal message in bits (`L * 8`) is appended as a 64-bit big-endian integer using [`int.to_bytes(length=1, byteorder='big', *, signed=False)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.to_bytes).\n",

    "  To ensure that the message plus the appended length fits exactly into these 64-byte blocks, the padding is added so that, before appending the length, the total length is 56 bytes modulo 64. This way, when the 8-byte length is added, the overall length becomes a full 64-byte block.\n"
