    "# **Task 1: Binary Representations**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this task, we focus on implementing several core functions that manipulate binary representations of 32-bit unsigned integers. These operations are crucial in many fields, including cryptography (like SHA-256), data encoding, and low-level programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circular Shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular shifts (or bit rotations) involve shifting the bits of a number to the left or right, with the bits that \"fall off\" one end reappearing on the opposite end. This operation is distinct from logical shifts, where bits shifted off one end are simply discarded and zeros are introduced on the other end. Circular shifts maintain the bit-length and the overall \"weight\" of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you perform a left circular shift (`rotl`) on a 32-bit integer:\n",
    "- The bits are moved to the left by a specified number of positions.\n",
    "- The bits that move past the most significant bit are wrapped around to the least significant bit positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a right circular shift (`rotr`) moves bits to the right with wrapping from the rightmost bits to the leftmost positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information, see the [Circular Shift Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bitwise Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several bitwise operators that allow for efficient manipulation of integers at the binary level:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AND (`&`):** Compares each bit of two integers and returns `1` only if both bits are `1`.\n",
    "- **OR (`|`):** Compares each bit of two integers and returns `1` if at least one of the bits is `1`.\n",
    "- **XOR (`^`):** Returns `1` for each bit position where the corresponding bits of the two operands are different.\n",
    "- **NOT (`~`):** Inverts the bits of the operand.\n",
    "- **Left Shift (`<<`):** Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.\n",
    "- **Right Shift (`>>`):** Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators form the foundation for our binary manipulation functions. Detailed explanations and examples can be found at [GeeksforGeeks Bitwise Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-bitwise-operators/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Task 1 involves implementing critical binary operations using circular shifts and bitwise operators. These functions serve as building blocks for more complex algorithms like SHA-256 and are widely applicable in many areas of computer science. By understanding and implementing `rotl`, `rotr`, `ch`, and `maj`, you not only gain proficiency in bitwise manipulation but also lay the groundwork for further exploration into cryptographic and low-level programming concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further reading and a deeper understanding, explore the [Circular Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift) and [Bitwise Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-bitwise-operators/) articles.\n"

    "\n",
    "After testing various candidates—such as bases `[31, 37, 257]` and moduli `[101, 127, 10_007]`—the values `31` and `101` have emerged as effective choices. As highlighted in Joshua Bloch's [*Effective Java*](https://ia800308.us.archive.org/16/items/java_20230528/Joshua%20Bloch%20-%20Effective%20Java%20%283rd%29%20-%202018.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "* The value `31` was chosen because it is an odd prime. If it were even and the multiplication overflowed, information would be lost, because multiplication by `2` is equivalent to shifting. The advantage of using a prime is less clear, but it is traditional.  \n",
    "* A nice property of `31` is that the multiplication can be replaced by a shift and a subtraction for better performance on some architectures: `31 * i == (i << 5) - i`. Modern VMs do this sort of optimization automatically.\n",
    "This allows faster computation on certain architectures.\n",
    "* Since `31 < 32`, it stays within the bit-width of a 32-bit processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `31` as the multiplier helps to generate a well-distributed hash by combining the contributions of each character in a string. Its odd prime nature avoids the pitfalls of even multipliers—such as losing information on overflow—and the computational shortcut (shifting and subtracting) can improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the modulus `101` is chosen because it is a prime number. A prime modulus helps minimize collisions by ensuring a more uniform distribution of hash values. While the exact advantage of using a prime modulus like `101` might be less pronounced than that of the multiplier, it remains a traditional choice that has been proven effective in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the combination of `31` and `101` has been historically favored in hash function design due to their mathematical properties and performance benefits, which remain relevant even as testing with other numbers (e.g., `37`, `257` for the base and `127`, `10_007` for the modulus) might show similar behavior in certain scenarios.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Reading the file:**\n",
    "    * file is opened using binary mode (i.e., \"rb\"). \n",
    "    * entire content of the file is read into `data`. \n",
    "    * length of the file (in bytes) is stored in a variable (let’s call it `L`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Appending the `1` Bit:**\n",
    "    In SHA256 (and other SHA-2 algorithms), the first step of padding is to signal the end of the original message. This is done by appending a single `1` bit to the message.Although only a single bit is needed, bytes are the smallest addressable unit in computer memory. Thus, the 1 bit is appended as part of a full byte. The byte `0x80` in hexadecimal corresponds to the binary value `10000000`. After appending 0x80, the new message consists of the original data followed by this byte.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero Padding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   We then calculate how many zero bytes are needed so that the total length (original message + `0x80` + zeros) is 56 bytes modulo 64. This ensures that when we later add the 8-byte length, the full message length becomes a multiple of 64 bytes (512 bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Let `L` be the original length (in bytes).\n",
    "   * After appending `0x80`, the length becomes `L + 1`.\n",
    "   * The formula used is:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     pad_len = (56 - (L + 1) % 64) % 64\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "    This ensures:\n",
    "    * If `(L + 1)` already leaves a remainder of 56 when divided by 64, no additional zero bytes are required.\n",
    "    * Otherwise, it computes exactly how many 0x00 bytes are needed to reach the target length of 56 modulo 64.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Appeding the Message Length:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The SHA256 padding requires that the last 8 bytes of the padded message represent the length of the original message in bits. This fixed-size representation ensures that the total message length is accurately recorded. Since the original length is in bytes (L), multiplying it by 8 converts it to bits (L * 8). This length is then represented as a 64-bit (8-byte) big-endian integer. In big-endian order, the most significant byte is placed first, which is crucial for consistency across different systems and aligns with the SHA256 specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Python, this conversion can be done using `struct.pack('>Q', L * 8)`, where '[>Q'](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) denotes an unsigned 64-bit big-endian integer. Alternatively, you can use `int.to_bytes(8, 'big')` on the computed bit length. This 8-byte representation is appended to the padded message, ensuring that the overall length of the padded message is a multiple of 64 bytes."

    "\n",
    "Prime numbers have long been a subject of fascination for mathematicians. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. They form the “building blocks” of integers because every integer can be uniquely factored into primes—a principle known as [the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic). Beyond their theoretical importance, prime numbers are also central to modern cryptography, particularly in secure communication systems like RSA. \n",

Since primes greater than 3 cannot be divisible by 2 or 3, they must leave a remainder of either 1 or 5 when divided by 6 (i.e. they are of the form `6𝑘+1 or 6k+5 `). This means that when checking if a number is prime, we only need to test numbers in these two forms, which cuts down on the number of checks."

    "1. **Inner loop reduction**: Skips comparisons over the already sorted tail (`range(n - 1 - i)`).\n",
    "2. **Early exit**: Detects if a full pass completes without any swaps and exits early.\n",
